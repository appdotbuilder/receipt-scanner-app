    // 1. Build dynamic WHERE clause based on provided filters:
    //    - query: search in store_name and item names
    //    - store_name: exact or partial match on store name
    //    - date_from/date_to: filter by receipt_date range
    //    - min_amount/max_amount: filter by total_amount range
    // 2. Query receipts table with relation to receipt_items
    // 3. Order by receipt_date DESC
    // 4. Return matching receipts with their items
